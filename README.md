# coding-challenges

This repository is keeping my personal coding challenge solutions.
They are publicly available and organize in packages according to the source.

The repository is, at the root level, organized in folders per language.
Anyway, the majority of the challenges would be in Java.

## Commands

Make sure you are in the java directory
``` Shell
cd java
```

Java tests:
``` Shell
./mvnw test
```
